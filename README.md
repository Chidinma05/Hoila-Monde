Another repository
i am new to the world of code, have no prior experience/knowledge.. it is a bit challenging but im sure that is what comes with change and as such, i will get a hang of it sooner than i think
i will master this act and get into Andela as a software developer.
Always had a thing for computers but never had anyone put me through on what to do with it lol.
